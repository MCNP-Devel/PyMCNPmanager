# PyMCNPmanager

This python library aims to help developing and managing an MCNP simulation. When
installed you'll be able to execute the python script ```MCNPmanager -h```. The -h
parameter will *help* and guide you though the usage of the script.

### version 0.1.0
it is still a development version. Only ```MCNPmanager init PATH``` will work as it
should.


Installation
------------

Installing the latest stable repo is an easy task, just:

```

```

While if you want to get the latest *development* **unstable** repo, just execute
the command above and ad this trailing string ```@dev``` .
