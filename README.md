# PyMCNPmanager

This python library aims to help developing and managing an MCNP simulation. When
installed you'll be able to execute the python script ```MCNPmanager -h```. The -h
parameter will *help* and guide you though the usage of the script.

### version 0.1.0
it is still a development version. Only ```MCNPmanager init PATH``` will work as it
should.

pip install git+https://github.com/ipostuma/PyMCNPmanager.git
