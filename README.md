# PyMCNPmanager

This python library aims to help developing and managing an MCNP simulation. When
installed you'll be able to execute the python script ```MCNPmanager -h```. The -h
parameter will *help* and guide you through the usage of the script.

### version 0.1.1
it is still a development version, but these commands work:

+ MCNPmanager init PATH #start a new MCNPmanager project
+ MCNPmanager cd PATH #copy an MCNPmanager project into an existing one
+ MCNPmanager build # build the MCNP input file

Requirements
------------

+ Python. Versions >= 3 are not supported

Installation

While if you want to get the latest *development* **unstable** repo, just execute
the command above and ad this trailing string ```@dev``` .
